	<h1><b>Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, with stars to fill my dream.</h1>
<h2>	I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been.</h2>
<h3>	To sit with elders of a gentle race this world has seldom seen.</h3>
<p>Who talk of days for which they sit and wait</p>
<p>When all will be revealed.</b></p>
